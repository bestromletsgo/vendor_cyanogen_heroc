This is an unofficial vendor setup for Heroc devices.

It was pieced together by Cyanogen. A shipping device is required to pull
the proprietary files needed to build the system (via adb).  Run the
"extract-files.sh" script before building.

To make android, first follow the instructions over at source.android.com/download until you installed repo
from there you will do this

$repo init -u git://github.com/cyanogen/android.git -b eclair-ds
$repo sync

the sync should take a few hours, take a nap or have some coffee in the meantime

now youre going to need to remove the dream_sapphire vendor tree and replace it with this one

$rm -fr vendor/htc/dream_sapphire
$cp -r /path/to/my/vendor/ vendor/htc/dream_sapphire

after thats done you'll need to extract proprietary bits. plug your phone into your computer, make sure adb has proper permissions, then

$pushd vendor/htc/dream_sapphire
$./extract-files.sh
$popd

from there source the envsetup.sh

$ . build/envsetup.sh

then lunch cyanogen_dream_sapphire-eng and build cyanogenmod with make 

$lunch cyanogen_dream_sapphire-eng
$make -j4

this will take a long time depending on your computing power. after its done, your product will be in out/target/product/dream_sapphire/
