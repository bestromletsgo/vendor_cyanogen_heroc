This is an unofficial vendor setup for Heroc devices.

It was pieced together by Cyanogen. A shipping device is required to pull
the proprietary files needed to build the system (via adb).  Run the
"extract-files.sh" script before building.

To make android, first follow the instructions over at source.android.com/download until you installed repo
from there you will do this

$repo init -u git://github.com/cyanogen/android.git
$repo sync

the sync should take a few hours, take a nap or have some coffee in the meantime

from there source the envsetup.sh

$ . build/envsetup.sh

then lunch cyanogen_dream_sapphire-eng and buid cyanogenmod with make otapakage

$lunch cyanogen_dream_sapphire-eng
$make otapackage

This will make an update.zip for you to distribute. have fun
